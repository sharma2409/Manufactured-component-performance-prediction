## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, load_packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)
library(matrixStats)
```

```{r, read-in}

data_url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jyurko/INFSCI_2595_Spring_2021/main/HW/final_project/infsci_2595_s21_final_project_data.csv'

df <- readr::read_csv(data_url, col_names = TRUE)
```

```{r}
df_step_1 <- df %>% select(xA, xB, x01:x06, response_1)
```


```{r}
df_scaled <- df_step_1
df_scaled[3:9] <- scale(df_step_1[3:9])

df_scaled %>% glimpse()

```


```{r, linear_response_1}
mod_01 <- lm(response_1 ~ xA + xB, data = df_scaled) #Discrete inputs as additive terms for response_1
mod_02 <- lm(response_1 ~ x01 + x02 + x03 + x04 + x05 + x06, data = df_scaled) # All Continuous inputs as additive terms for response_1
mod_03 <- lm(response_1 ~ xA + xB + x01 + x02 + x03 + x04 + x05 + x06, data = df_scaled) # Step 1 Continuous inputs as additive terms for response_1
mod_04 <- lm(response_1 ~ splines::ns(x01 + x02 + x03 + x04 + x05 + x06, df = 5), data = df_scaled)
```

```{r, performance_r-squared}
#Calculate RMSE values
RMSE_results <- list(modelr::rmse(mod_01, df_scaled),modelr::rmse(mod_02, df_scaled),modelr::rmse(mod_03, df_scaled),modelr::rmse(mod_04, df_scaled))
names(RMSE_results) <- c('mod_01','mod_02','mod_03','mod_04')

RMSE_results
```

On the basis of the RMSE, the model with all inputs (both continuous and discrete) is the best, followed by the model which has all continuous inputs as additive terms.

```{r}
coefplot::coefplot(mod_03)
```


```{r}
coefplot::coefplot(mod_01)
```
In mod_01 except xBB2 all coefficients are statistically significant.

In mod_03 except x03,x04,x05 and x06 all coefficients are statistically significant.
